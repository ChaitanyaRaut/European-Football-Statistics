# European-Football-Statistics
All the interesting stats about a football season in Europe's top leagues at one place!

I often find that I have to go to different websites to calculate some of 
interestic statistics euorpean football such as 

1. Who is leading the charts for most goals scored in season?
2. Who is leading the race for the Golden Shoe?
3. Which club is still undefeated and in which competetions?

Thorugh this project I will aim to have all such stats at a single source.

The stats will be collected for  -
1. Top 5 leagues + UEFA competetions initially. Domestic cups and other leagues could be added later.
2. Top 5 players from each competetion.
3. Overall stats for a club in a season (Played, Won, Drawn, Lost, Goals Scored, Conceded).

Any other interesting stats that I may find later
