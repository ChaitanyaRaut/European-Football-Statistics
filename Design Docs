Version 1.0 - 
Create an object representing a Player.
Attributes- League Goals, Goals in UEFA.

What about Tournament object? 

How to a tournament, a player and goals in a tournament are related?

First Approach - 
A player has 3 attributes domestic league, continental league and domestic cup. Each of them will have statistics in these competitions.
Will combine all of the stats into another attribute.
Problem? - Need a database focused on players not competitions. All of the data is available according to a tournament. Need to get this 
data into my form.
